                    <p> Welcome to the FrontEnder's final Web Programming (CSC4370) Project!</p>
                    <p>The goal of this project is to make a fully functionaal website for our 
                    startup idea --- Property Hub --- A team of developers worked on it with 
                    the aim that it brings property buyers and sellers together under one platform.
                    This website takes the form of three working portals made to work together. 
                    They are as follows:
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="little-label">About Page:</span> This is the landing page, or the 
                    current page being displayed. It contains information about the purpose of the site,
                    and answers a few quetions our customers may have in an FAQ Format. Most importantly,
                    It allows the user, to register and login. It serves as a connection to the rest of our
                    site.</p>
                    <p><span class="little-label">User Registration & Login:</span> The registration page allows a new customer
                    to provide important information for us to best serve them along with an encrypted password
                    to be able to log in again. They are then redirected to the login page where they enter a user
                    and password which is verified against values stored in a database. If correct, they access the website.  </p>
                    <p><span class="little-label">Seller's Dashboard:</span> This page contains all the properties tied to a specific
                    user along with all of those propertie's details (features commonly associated with a property). This is the page
                    that also provides the user the ability to add new properties. </p>
